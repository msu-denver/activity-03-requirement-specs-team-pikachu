# Instructions

In this activity, you and your teammates will create a high-level requirement spec list for a web application for saving cooking recipes. Each requirement specification must be clear enough to be understood by stakeholders. Furthermore, they should be written in plain-English using 1-3 sentences. Lastly, each specification should be classified into functional user requirements, non-functional user requirements, or system requirements. For example: 

* Users should be able to create their own recipes. Functional requirement. 
* The system should be able to authenticate users. Non-functional requirement. 
* The system should be able to be accessed using Chrome relase 100 or superior. System requirement.
